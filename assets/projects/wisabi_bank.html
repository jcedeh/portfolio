    <h2>üìà Key Insights</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Wisabi Bank, one of Nigeria‚Äôs leading financial institutions headquartered in Lagos, operates branches across Kano, 
          Rivers State, Enugu, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja. With a wide portfolio of financial services including 
          savings accounts, current accounts, loans, and investments, the bank‚Äôs ATM network is a crucial touchpoint for customer interaction.
          This analysis examines the bank‚Äôs ATM transaction data to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities for operational improvement.</p>

        <p>Across all states, the total transaction amount reached an impressive ‚Ç¶39 billion, with an average transaction amount of ‚Ç¶17,980. 
          The network processed approximately 2 million transactions during the period under review.</p>

        <p>Lagos is the top-performing location with the highest average transaction amount. Most transactions in Lagos are withdrawals, 
        averaging ‚Ç¶23,300, followed by transfers at ‚Ç¶20,900. No balance inquiries were made in Lagos during the analysis period. 
        FCT comes next with a similar pattern, while Kano has the lowest transaction volume and value.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/avg. trans by state trans type.PNG" alt="">
        
        <p>When looking at transaction frequency by time of day, Lagos once again leads. 
          The afternoon period (12 p.m. ‚Äì 6 p.m.) sees the highest activity with 320,000 transactions, followed by 
          evenings (230,000) and mornings (200,000). Kano follows Lagos in afternoon and morning activity, 
          while Port Harcourt records the lowest daily transactions.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/trans cout by location.PNG" alt="">

        <p>Customers aged 35 and above account for the highest number of transactions, dominated by withdrawals worth ‚Ç¶10.7 billion, 
          followed by transfers worth ‚Ç¶4.1 billion. The 25‚Äì35 age group follows, also favoring withdrawals.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/age group trans type.PNG" alt="">

        <p>In terms of professions, Human Resource Specialists in the 35+ age group lead with an average transaction amount of ‚Ç¶20,389 
          across 672 transactions. Electricians aged 25‚Äì35 follow with an average of ‚Ç¶19,663 over 645 transactions, 
          while Welders in the same age range have the lowest average transaction amount (‚Ç¶17,467) despite a higher transaction count (742).</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/trans by occup.PNG" alt="">

        <p>There is a consistent correlation between transaction volume and transaction amount, both showing similar month-to-month fluctuations. 
          March stands out as the peak month with ‚Ç¶353 million in transaction value and 196,327 transactions. 
          February recorded the lowest figures at ‚Ç¶290 million and 161,418 transactions. Months such as May, July, October, 
          and December maintained upward trends, while April, June, August, September, and November followed a downward pattern.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/trans volum, amount by month.PNG" alt="">

        <p>Across all locations, withdrawals remain the most common transaction type, followed by transfers. 
          These transactions are largely conducted by Wisabi Bank customers. Lagos ranks first in transaction counts, 
          followed by Kano, with Rivers State trailing.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/trans typ by variat.PNG" alt="">

        <p>Within Lagos, withdrawals account for 19.58% of transactions, transfers for 7.8%, deposits for 3.9%, and balance inquiries 
          for 3.92%. Withdrawals are most frequent in the afternoon, contributing 8.35% to the 15% total transactions during that period.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/percentage.PNG" alt="">

        <p>Most transactions are between ‚Ç¶0 and ‚Ç¶10,000, with a total of 923,521 transactions. Next are ‚Ç¶10,000‚Äì‚Ç¶20,000 with 436,387 
          transactions and ‚Ç¶20,000‚Äì‚Ç¶30,000 with 406,888 transactions. The least common is ‚Ç¶30,000‚Äì‚Ç¶40,000 with 25,511 transactions, 
          while ‚Ç¶40,000‚Äì‚Ç¶50,000 has 273,604. Large transactions of ‚Ç¶90,000‚Äì‚Ç¶100,000 total 77,927, with some outliers found in this range.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/distribution.PNG" alt="">

        <p>Lekki ATM is used the most, followed by Ikorodu. Surprisingly, Sabon Gari ATM has more transactions than Ikorodu but handles 
          less money, meaning it is not fully used in terms of value. This shows that the number of transactions alone doesn‚Äôt fully 
          measure ATM performance; the amount of money transacted also matters.</p>
              <img src="/images/pictures/utiliz rate.PNG" alt="">

        <p>In terms of transaction duration, Kano customers have the highest average at 4.89 minutes, driven mostly by factory workers 
          (average 5.50 minutes), plumbers, and welders. FCT follows with an average of 4.18 minutes, led by mechanics who are non-Wisabi 
          customers. Enugu records the shortest transaction duration at 3.67 minutes, dominated by farmers performing withdrawals.</p>

    <h2>üí°Reccommendations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enhance ATM Capacity in High-Demand Locations:</strong> Deploy additional ATMs or optimize machine uptime in Lagos and 
            Kano, particularly in the afternoons, to meet demand surges and reduce wait times.</li>
          <li><strong>Targeted Marketing by Age Group & Profession:</strong> Make special withdrawal and transfer offers for customers aged 35 
            and above, and for professionals like HR specialists and electricians. Give discounts on transaction fees or loyalty rewards to welders 
            and other customers who make many small transactions, so they keep using the bank‚Äôs services.</li>
          <li><strong>Balance ATM Network Utilization:</strong> Review the location of low-performing ATMs like Sabon Gari and either move 
            them to a better spot or change the marketing plan to bring in more high-value transactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal Demand Planning:</strong> Get ready for busy transaction months like March by stocking enough cash in ATMs and 
            planning maintenance ahead of time.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourage Higher-Value Transactions:</strong> Give rewards or benefits for medium to high withdrawals and transfers, 
            especially for amounts between ‚Ç¶30,000 and ‚Ç¶40,000 where fewer transactions happen.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce Transaction Duration:</strong> Investigate the causes of longer transaction durations in Kano and FCT, 
            particularly for factory workers and mechanics, and streamline machine processes or provide user assistance.</li>
        </ul>
