    <h1>üìä Forggith Pharmaceuticals Sales and Marketing Analysis</h1>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Forggith Pharmaceuticals (Forggith) is a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing 
      company based in Germany. As a Manufacturing company, they produce medical drugs which get to the 
      consumers through their Distributors.
    </p>

    <p>
      In their efforts to maximize growth, Forggith works with a team of Sales and Marketing pros 
        who ensure retailers are able to get their products through the distributors. 
        That is, Forggith does not sell directly to retailers or end-users, they sell to Distributors. 
          But they maintain interaction with retailers, through their Sales and Marketing pros.
    </p>

    <h2>Power BI Reporting Requirement.</h2>
    
    <p>Forggith is looking to create some Power BI Reports to assist in guiding their strategies, 
      tactics and operations as a company. For a start, they have identified a couple of numbers they will 
      like to report from their data as reports.

    <h2>üéØ Objective</h2>
    <p>Forggith is looking to create some Power BI Reports to assist in guiding their strategies, 
      tactics and operations as a company. </p>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>Power BI</li>
      <li>DAX STUDIO</li>
      <li>Microsoft Word</li>
    </ul>

   
    
      

    <h2>üìÅ Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The dataset used for this project is stored in two different Excel workbooks: 
      the Actual Dataset and the Target Dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Target Dataset contains the following columns: product_id, sales_rep_id, month, 
      and the target years 2022, 2023, and 2025. The values under these year columns represent the 
      expected sales amounts for each sales representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Actual Dataset workbook comprises seven sheets, which include information on supporting dimensions 
      such as products, employees, locations, and channels, as well as the actual sales records for the years 
      2022 through 2025.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>üßπ  Data Cleaning and Transformation:</h2>
    <p>
      In preparing the dataset for analysis, I first noted that the Actual Sales and Target Sales tables were 
      maintained as two separate fact tables. This was necessary because they exist at different levels of granularity, 
      and therefore establishing a direct relationship between them would not be appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
      To streamline the Actual Sales data, I appended the 2023‚Äì2025 sales sheets to the 2022 sales sheet, 
      consolidating them into a single unified table. I then pivoted the year columns (2022, 2023, 2024) into a 
      single column to create a proper structure where each row represents a year with its corresponding values.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>after pivot</em></p>
    <img src="images/pharm/after pivot.PNG" alt="">

    <p>
      For the data model, I implemented a star schema, establishing relationships between the fact tables and their 
      corresponding dimension tables. One key challenge arose with the Channel and Subchannel dimensions. 
      The Channel dimension could not be directly related to the fact table, and linking Channel to Subchannel 
      would have violated the star schema principle of dimension-to-fact relationships. To resolve this, 
      I merged Channel and Subchannel into a single dimension table, ensuring a clean and compliant model design.

      Additionally, I created a Calendar table using the CALENDARAUTO() function to support time intelligence 
      calculations and enhance trend analysis across the dataset.
    </p>

    <h2>üìà Key Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The company generated a total revenue of ‚Ç¶11 billion, with year-to-date revenue at ‚Ç¶3 billion, 
      matching the previous year-to-date but below the ‚Ç¶8 billion recorded in the same period last year. 
      Against a total target of ‚Ç¶8 billion, performance was strong, achieving a ratio of 1.32, 
      while month-over-month revenue grew by 3%.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a geographical perspective, Baesweile stood out as the highest-performing location with ‚Ç¶52 million, 
      while Limburg and Eberswalde followed with ‚Ç¶28 million and ‚Ç¶27 million, respectively. At the same time, 
      sales performance against year-to-date targets revealed a shortfall: while the target was ‚Ç¶3 billion, 
      actual achievement was ‚Ç¶2 billion.
    </p>
    <img src="images/pharm/Revenue distribution by location.PNG" alt="">

    <p>
      Channel analysis showed that pharmacies contributed more revenue (‚Ç¶6 billion) than hospitals (‚Ç¶5 billion). 
      Product-wise, analgesics led with ‚Ç¶2.25 billion, followed by antiseptics (‚Ç¶2.10 billion) and mood stabilizers (‚Ç¶1.94 billion). Antimalarials, however, performed the lowest, generating only ‚Ç¶1.40 billion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among sales representatives, Abigail led with ‚Ç¶0.929 billion, closely trailed by Jimmy (‚Ç¶0.928 billion) 
      and Sheila (‚Ç¶0.903 billion). In terms of target achievement, Stella Given stood out with 1.66%, 
      followed by Jimmy Grey (1.60%) and Daniel Gates (1.52%), while Anne Wu posted the weakest performance.

    <p>
      Looking at team contributions, Delta Team emerged as the top performer, delivering 30.84% of overall revenue. 
      Charlie and Bravo Teams contributed 23.97% and 23.39%, respectively, while Alpha Team recorded the lowest 
      share at 21.79%.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, when analyzing both revenue and sales volume, analgesics once again dominated with ‚Ç¶2.2 billion in 
      revenue and 53 million units sold. Antiseptics and mood stabilizers followed with ‚Ç¶2.1 billion and ‚Ç¶1.9 billion, 
      respectively. Antimalarials, despite achieving a massive volume of 1.4 billion units, generated only ‚Ç¶0.4 billion, 
      pointing to a significant price-to-volume imbalance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In conclusion, while the company has exceeded its overall revenue target, performance gaps exist across certain 
      products, teams, and sales representatives. Addressing these gaps will be critical to sustaining revenue growth 
      and achieving consistency in performance across the organization.
    </p>

    <h2>üí°Recommendation</h2>
    <p>
      For Sales Representatives: Reps should consistently track their individual performance against targets to identify 
      gaps early. By doing so, they can adjust their marketing activities‚Äîsuch as customer engagement, product focus, 
      and channel prioritization‚Äîto maximize their revenue contribution
    </p>

    <p>
      For Team Managers: Managers should monitor their teams‚Äô performance throughout the reporting periods. 
      By identifying underperforming members and best practices from high achievers, managers can reallocate resources, 
      provide targeted training, and plan corrective actions to boost overall team effectiveness.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Executive Team: The leadership should focus on tracking overall revenue trends against set targets to 
      guide medium- to long-term strategies. Strategic decisions, such as adjusting product pricing 
      (e.g., antimalarials), reallocating investments between pharmacy and hospital channels, and scaling successful 
      sales approaches, will help maintain growth momentum and improve alignment with business objectives.
