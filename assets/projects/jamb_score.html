    <h1>üìä What Drives Success? Investigating JAMB Performance Through Student Behavior</h1>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong>  
    The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is Nigeria‚Äôs examination body 
    responsible for conducting entrance exams into universities, polytechnics, 
    and colleges of education. It was established in 1978 to centralize and standardize 
    the admission process. JAMB conducts the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) 
    and also manages Direct Entry admissions. The board introduced Computer-Based Testing (CBT) 
    to ensure fairness, reduce malpractice, and make result processing faster.
    </p>

    <h2>üéØ Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of this analysis is to explore how student behavior, academic environment, 
      and socio-demographic factors influence JAMB performance.</p>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Power BI</li>
      <li>Microsoft Word</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìÅ Dataset Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This jamb result dataset is gotten from Kaggle: Students Performance in 2024 JAMB. 
        This dataset was generated using statistics from the 2024 Joint Admissions and Matriculation 
        Board (JAMB) examination. </li>
      <li>The dataset consists of 5000 rows and 17 columns.</li>
    </ul>
  

    <h2>üßπ Data Cleaning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Calculated the Percentage of Students Attending Extra Tutorials:</strong>
          Created a DAX measure to determine what proportion of the students in the dataset attend extra 
          tutorial sessions. This helped in analyzing the impact of extra tutorials on academic 
          performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Binned Study Hours into Intervals:</strong>
          Added a new column using DAX to categorize students' study hours per week into 5-hour intervals. 
          This binning made it easier to visualize and analyze study patterns across defined ranges. 
          Extracted time from the TransactionStartTime and 
        TransactionEndTime columns to create Start Time and End Time columns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìà Key Insights</h2>
    <article>
        <p>This analysis explores how student behavior, academic environment, and socio-demographic factors 
          influence JAMB performance. By examining over 5,000 students, we aimed to identify what truly impacts success, 
          and what doesn‚Äôt.</p>
        <h3>Student Behavior and Academic Habits</h3>

        <p>The average JAMB score across all students is 174, with an average of 19 study hours per week. 
          The highest score is 367, and the lowest is 100.
        <p>Interestingly, while 54.42% of students attend extra tutorials, performance varies significantly 
          based on deeper behavioral and background factors.</p>
        </p>

        <p>Students who study more hours per week tend to score significantly higher, 
          assignment completion and exposure to qualified teachers also correlate strongly with higher scores,
          students who demonstrate knowledge in IT tend to outperform their peers; signaling that digital literacy 
          may be an academic enabler.
        </p>
        <p>Effort and engagement: measured by study time, IT awareness, and assignment completion, 
          consistently align with academic success.

        <h3>The Role of the Academic Environment</h3>

        <p>Private school students have higher average JAMB scores compared to public school students.</p>
        <p>Students with shorter distances to school tend to perform better, especially those with very high scores.</p>
        <p>Access matters: proximity to school and the quality of the learning environment appear to influence outcomes.</p>

              <img src="/images/jamb/distance to school.png" alt="">

        <h3>Socio-Demographics and Family Support</h3>

        <p> Students whose parents have higher education levels tend to achieve better scores.</p>
        <p>Parent involvement is another key factor: students with engaged parents perform noticeably better.</p>

              <img src="/images/jamb/parent involvement.png" alt="">
            
        <h3>What Didn‚Äôt Matter (and Why That‚Äôs Important)</h3>

        <p>Not all factors we explored were influential. For instance, we found no significant correlation between 
          some commonly assumed drivers like school distance in general (except for very high scorers) or tutorial 
          attendance, access to learning materials, age and gender. This highlights the importance of data validation 
          over assumptions.

    <h2>üí°Recommendation</h2>
    <p>To boost JAMB performance at scale, focus should be placed on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encouraging consistent study habits</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Improving teacher quality</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Enhancing parental involvement</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Promoting IT literacy</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Addressing socio-economic gaps</strong></li>
        </ul>
    <p>These insights provide a foundation for targeted intervention and educational policy reform.</p>
